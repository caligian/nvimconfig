Introduction *_introduction*

Originally inspired by doom-nvim and doom-emacs. However, there are some
things I disagree with them mainly regarding the philosophy of heavy
'preconfiguration' over providing a robust configuration API instead. This
framework does the opposite, it rather provides you with the tools to create
your own modules and make advanced configurations. However, this fraemwork is
more or less IDE-ready framework at least for python, ruby and lua.

This framework is intended to ease the process of configuration for a neovim
user. It provided a robust set of builtin modules intended to be used by the
user. You can view them by using the command :Help<module>.

Requirements *_requirements*

You need some external dependencies as it is usually the case with some of the
plugins like telescope.nvim ripgrep, etc. Here's a comprehensive list

GUI editors (optional):
- Neovide 

Terminal (either):
- kitty
- alacritty

From your repo (You will have to confirm with your repo):
- ripgrep
- fd/fdfind
- luarocks

Additionally, you might need nodejs, rubygems, ruby-bundler, in order to use
with Mason.vim to download formatters, linters, LSP, etc
